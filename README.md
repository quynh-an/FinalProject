\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is the README for my final project, which is a password generator. It will be created in a .py file. In that file, when run, a link can be made to an HTML file. It will include user interaction and input as well as displying back to the user. Users can input information into a form to create a password. A link will be on the passsword generation page to see if you want to see an old password you created. Methods include randomizing characters, symbols, and numbers and creating strings of these. New team members will need to download the .py file of the program to make edits locally and can use GitHub to access any changes. GitHub will also have the README file, but if team members want it locally, they will need to download that as well. }
